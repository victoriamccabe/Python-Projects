# Python Projects Repository

This repo showcases the projects and exercises I’ve completed as part of a Python programming course. It includes Python projects developed to build foundational and intermediate skills in programming, GUI development, and web application design. The course covers a range of Python technologies from basic scripting and data handling to Tkinter-based GUIs, Django web applications, and core Python functionality.
